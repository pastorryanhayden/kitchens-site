          <div class="entry-content"><p>Though we did not allow the domain name to expire, <a href="whatawordisthis.com">our ministry website</a> has been lying dormant for some time now and, frankly, I am coming to grips with the fact that I have vastly underutilized this great medium.  Let me give you a brief history of this website.</p>
<p>It all started in 2008 when my wife and I purchased our first home computer.  Up until then, we both had been using an antiquated Sony Vaio that I had brought into the marriage.  We pinched our pennies and decided to go with an iMac.  At the time, just two years into our marriage, it was a major financial decision, but we decided to invest in our money in a home computer that we could trust and use for years to come.  We are still using this computer to this day, and it has been a wonderful tool for many purposes.<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vZ8wp1i.jpg" alt="enter image description here"> </p>
<p>Once we set up the new computer, I quickly discovered a program called &quot;iWeb&quot;.  As I begin to look through this program, I started having fun with it and designing a website for our preaching ministry.  What started as a little fun with a new computer program led to a fully designed website.  My primary intention for the website was not to promote the ministry, but to provide resources to others that had encouraged me.  I then had to seek for a domain name.  At the time, I was teaching a series on the transmission of scripture and why the Authorized Version (King James Bible) is to be preferred over all other English translations.  This series was entitled, &quot;What A Word Is This!&quot; taken from Luke 4:36.  Amazingly, the domain &quot;<a href="http://whatawordisthis.com">whatawordisthis.com</a>&quot; was available.  I have owned it since then.  I posted sermons, photos, blog-like posts, etc...on a regular basis and it seemed to be a blessing to a limited audience.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the iWeb service ceased at some point and the site lay dormant for some time.  I attempted to resurrect the site in the summer of 2014 with a fresh design by <a href="http://pastorryanhayden.com">Pastor Ryan Hayden</a>`.  Pastor Hayden did a wonderful job designing the site; I didn&#39;t do such a great job completing the info that Pastor Hayden needed and updating contect regularly.  Additionally, something else kind of wonderful happened toward the end of that year.  I was called to pastor the Corinth Missionary Baptist Church in Moulton, AL.  This confluence of several different events created a perfect storm in which web design/maintenance was the last thing on which I could focus my attention.  </p>
<p>So, what are we doing now?  Well, I have once again engaged Pastor Hayden to relaunch the site, this time as a part of the <a href="http://sitesfor.church">sitesfor.church</a> project, to reflect the current status of my preaching ministry as the Pastor of Corinth.  I hope to start posting sermon audio (though we have a lot of work to do at Corinth in order to increase the quality of our audio recordings) very soon.  I am also going to try my hand at blogging occasionally, posting sermon notes from different preaching series, etc.  Who knows where this might go!</p>
<p>The intent remains the same as the first site that I designed with iWeb,  I remember posting on that site that the intent was to &quot;<strong><em>Exalt the Saviour, Encourage the Saint and Evanglize the Sinner!</em></strong>&quot;  May God bless this effort to the end that His name may be made known in all the earth.  Your feedback is welcomed, and appreciated. </p>
